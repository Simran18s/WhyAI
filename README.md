WhyAI — Context-Aware News Explanations with RAG

WhyAI is an AI system that takes a news article, headline, or URL and generates grounded, context-aware explanations tailored to different perspectives (simple, neutral, investor).
Instead of summarizing news, WhyAI focuses on explaining why an event matters by enriching articles with historical, factual, and domain-specific context using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

Problem Statement

Modern news is often complex and written with implicit assumptions about background knowledge.
Generic LLM summaries risk hallucination, oversimplification, or omission of critical context.
WhyAI aims to build a reliable explanation system that prioritizes factual grounding, transparency, and explicit uncertainty in real-world news interpretation.
